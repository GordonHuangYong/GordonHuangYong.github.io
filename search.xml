    <content type="text"><![CDATA[An admin UI for the Hexo blog engine. Based off of the Ghost interface, with inspiration from svbtle and prose.io. Hexo VersionFor 2.x, use version 0.3.0 of this plugin. Version 1.x and beyond onlysupport Hexo v3.x. Contents Screenshots Quickstart Credits Local use vs deploymentThis plugin was originally designed as a local editor – you run hexo locally, use hexo-admin to author posts, and then use hexo generate or hexo deploy to send the generated static HTML files up to github pages or some other static server. However, hexo-admin can be run on your live blog, as long as you’re using a non-static hosting service such as Heroku, DigitalOcean, etc. Static hosting services such as Github pages and Surge.sh does not support running hexo-admin from your live site.If you’re using Hexo admin from your live blog, you should definitely set up a password (see below) – otherwise anyone will be able to edit your content. Screenshots Quickstart1. Setup hexo &amp; create a blog12345npm install -g hexocd ~/hexo init my-blogcd my-blognpm install 2. Install the admin &amp; start things up123npm install --save hexo-adminhexo server -dopen http://localhost:4000/admin/ 3. Profit!The UI should be pretty discoverable – let me know if you can’t find something. 4. Password protectionIf you’re using Hexo admin on your live server, you want some passwordprotection. To enable this, you just add a few config variables to your hexo_config.yml: 1234admin: username: myfavoritename password_hash: be121740bf988b2225a313fa1f107ca1 secret: a secret something The password_hash is the bcrypt hash of your password. The secret is usedto make the cookies secure, so it’s a good idea to have it be long andcomplicated. A utility in Hexo admin’s Settings can hash your password and generate the adminsection for you. Start Hexo and go to Settings &gt; Setup authentificationand fill out your information. Copy the generated YAML into your _config.yml. Once that’s in place, start up your hexo server and going to /admin/ willrequire you to enter your password. 5. Custom post metadataTo add and edit your own post metadata with the admin interface, add themetadata variable and your custom variables to your hexo _config.yml:123metadata: author_id: defaultAuthorId language: You can provide default values that will be used to initialize the metadataof a new post. 6. Contribute! let me know how it can be improved in the githubissues fork and pull-request Creditsbuilt with ❤ by Jared Forsyth(@jaredforsyth) usingreact, browserify, and less.]]></content>
